# Yet Another Game of Life in React

Implementing a [GOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is always undoubtedly fun, and that' should already settle the "why?"; I also wanted to get more comfortable with some React aspects (Context and rendering of many nodes) so this problem was a perfect fit.

I also wanted to use React by itself without any help from other libraries, so that this project can also be used as a starter or a tutorial of some sort. And maybe as a simple benchmark too.

## Features

- Each generation (10k cells) renders in 0.3s (on a 2015 MBP, ymmv)
- You can switch cells on while the game is running
- You can step forward and back

## Install

Just `npm install` and `npm start`.
